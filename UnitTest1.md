#This is a unit test example

FIND HIGHEST is a Python function that takes an array of integers and returns the highest number that appears more than once in the array. This one is crazy long but the signature can be way simpler.

The point here is to run unitTestTemplate.py from TERMINAL, this is where the action happens.



Function Signature: `def highest_duplicate_number(arr: List[int]) -> int:`

Example:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 16]
assert highest_duplicate_number(arr) == 16
