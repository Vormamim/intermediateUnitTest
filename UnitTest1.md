Write a Python function that takes an array of integers and returns the highest number that appears more than once in the array.

Function Signature: `def highest_duplicate_number(arr: List[int]) -> int:`

Example:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 16]
assert highest_duplicate_number(arr) == 16
